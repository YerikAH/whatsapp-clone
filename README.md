# WhatsApp clone
The cloned whatsapp graphical interface, developed with flutter.

## Development 

### Project structure
In the `assets` folder are all the files used by the application.

- **themes:** Files that contain the theme of the application.
- **screen:** The screen that the user can see.
- **widget:** They are like components, the screen folder depends on them.
- **models:** Models i use in data folder.
- **data:** I use it as a database in the application.



### My experience developing
- I had no complications with the development, I can say that it was easy. But it was a lot of fun, I had to think about how to simulate a database, about messages and contacts, that caused me some problems anyway, someday I'll have to make a Full Stack Mobile app.

### Technologies used in the project

2. [Dart](https://dart.dev/)
